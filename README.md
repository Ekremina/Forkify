<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

(https://forkify-v2.netlify.app/)

This project is a part of the Udemy course taught by Jonas. There are many food websites on the web, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a nice looking JS powered web app for searching recipes in elegant way.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating some amazing food. A food that solves a problem and brings happiness to the world
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks like going over the web to check how to make the same food


Of course, it is hard to have recipes for everyone so new ones are constantly added!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [Javascript]
* [CSS]
* [HTML]
